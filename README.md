# The Sims 4 Translator

_I don't know much English, so I used a translator to describe it. I'm sorry about that!_

This is a simple program for easy translation of mods for The Sims 4.  

## Features

- The translation of mods can be saved in dictionaries, which saves you from re-translating if new versions are released.
- Saving the translation as a separate file, or adding it directly to the mod.
- Saving translations from multiple mods to a single file.

## Usage Instructions

- In the settings, select the languages you plan to translate from and to.
- Open the mod (*.package)
- Translate.
- Save the dictionary if you plan to edit the translation or are going to translate new versions of the mod.
- Save the translation in a separate package or save the translation immediately in an open mod (finalization).
- Profit.

## Languages

Starting from version 1.2, the translation of the interface has been made into separate files. They are available in the folder:

`<app path>/prefs/interface/`

To add a new translation, you need to place the XML file with the new translation in this folder.
